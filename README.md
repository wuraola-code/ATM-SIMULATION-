ATM Simulation – Python Project

This is a beginner-level ATM simulation program written in Python. It allows users to log in with a 4-digit PIN and perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, withdrawing money, depositing funds, and exiting the system.

Features

✅ User login with PIN (hardcoded)

✅ Balance check

✅ Withdraw funds with insufficient balance check

✅ Deposit funds

✅ Exit/Logout system

How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the file as ATM_Simulation.py.
3. Run the script in a terminal or code editor like this:

python ATM_Simulation.py

The PIN is currently hardcoded as 1234. You can change it in the script.

This project uses basic Python features: conditionals, loops, user input, and simple math.

Great for practicing control flow logic!
